Things I like to do in Berkeley

* Stay safe during quarentine
* cool tasty meals
* Study hard for J-Rue's class

my plans for the weekends are:

1. Complete all of the assignments for J-Rue's class.
2. Double-check that I completed all of J-Rue's assignments.
3. Triple-check that all assignments are done.
